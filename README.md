# SDV-ChildrenDoChores
Make your children do your farm work for you!  Have them water, harvest, and plant crops, pet animals, and gather animal products from the barn and coop.

## Features
#### Chores
* **Water Crops:** Water all the crops on your farm.  Includes greenhouse crops by default, but you can disable this in the config.
* **Harvest Crops:** Harvest all the crops on your farm.  Includes greenhouse crops by default, but you can disable this in the config.
* **Replant Crops:** After harvesting, the child will replant any crops that do not regrow.  Requires two children -- one to harvest crops, and the other to replant them -- or for children to be able to perform more than one chore.  See [Configuring the Mod](#Configuring the Mod) for more information.  Includes greenhouse crops by default, but you can disable this in the config.
* **Water Pet Bowl:** Puts water in your pet's bowl.  Will still make the pet more friendly toward you.
* **Pet Animals:** Pets all animals on your farm.  Will still make the animals more friendly toward you.
* **Harvest Barn Products:**: Milk all cows and goats, and shear all sheep.
* **Harvest Coop Products:**: Collect eggs, wool, feathers, rabbits' feet, and so-on from all coops on your farm.

#### General
At the start of each day, each child will do their assigned chore and report back to you.  If they had to harvest crops or gather products from animals, the items they got will be put into your inventory.  The following features are turned on by default, but can be toggled off in the config:

* Children are limited to one chore per day.  You can increase this to make them do all the chores available.
* Children aren't good at their chore from the get-go.  They earn EXP every time they perform a chore, and once they have enough they "level up" and get better at the chore. 
* A child's level in a chore determines the quality of products they harvest.
